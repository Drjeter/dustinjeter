## Project: Freelance Studio Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for my professional freelance portfolio, designed to market web design services to therapists, coaches, and small businesses.

### 🎯 Objective
The goal was to build a high-performance, conversion-focused landing page that establishes trust and authority. Unlike typical template-based sites, this project demonstrates a "custom-first" approach to digital identity.

### 🛠️ Technical Strategy

*   **Architecture**: Built as a static single-page application (SPA) using **React 19** and **TypeScript**. This ensures instant page loads and a fluid user experience (UX) that outperforms traditional CMS-heavy sites.
*   **Styling System**: Implemented a custom design system with **Tailwind CSS**. I avoided generic component libraries to maintain full control over the visual hierarchy and branding, ensuring a truly custom "bespoke" feel.
*   **Serverless Infrastructure**: Integrated **Formspree** for contact form submissions. This architectural choice enables robust lead generation without the overhead of maintaining a backend server, significantly reducing hosting costs and security surface area.
*   **Performance**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals. The site achieves high performance scores through efficient asset bundling via **Vite** and proper semantic HTML structure.

### 💡 Key Features

*   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first architecture ensuring perfect rendering across all device sizes.
*   **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
*   **Modern Tooling**: Utilizes the latest React patterns (Hooks) and build tools for a modern development workflow.
